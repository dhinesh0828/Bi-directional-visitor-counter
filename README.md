# Bi-directional-visitor-counter:
# Abstract:
          Often we see visitor counters at stadium, mall, offices, class rooms etc. How they count the people and turn ON or OFF the light when nobody is inside? Today we are here with automatic room light controller project with bidirectional visitor counter by using Arduino Uno. It is very interesting project for hobbyists and students for fun as well as learning.
# Introduction:
             The project "Bi-directional visitor counter" is based on the interfacing of some components such as sensors, motors, etc. with arduino microcontroller. This counter can count people in both directions. The circuit can be used to count the number of persons entering into the room/hall in the entrance gate and it can count the number of persons leaving the hall by decrementing the count at same gate or exit gate and it depends upon sensor placements.
# Components Required:
        * Arduino UNO
        * Relay
        * IR sensors
        * 16*2 LCD display
        * Bread board
        * Connecting wires
        * Resistors
